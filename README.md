# How Many and Which Training Points Would Need to be Removed to Flip this Prediction?
Official implementation for the paper " How Many and Which Training Points Would Need to be Removed to Flip this Prediction?"

# Instruction
1. The Algorithm 1 is in ```IP``` function under ```Smallest_k.py```. The Algorithm 2 is in ```recursive_NT``` function under ```iterative.py```.
2. To run the algorithm for the ```SST``` dataset, you can use the command below:
```
python SST.py
```
3. To run the algorithm for the ```SST``` feature extracted from BERT, you can use the command:
```
python SST_bert.py
```
4. Other dataset information is provided in the ```data_links``` file.
